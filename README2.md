# Description

1. I've implemented 3 MCPTools.
2. Two of them were tested using GitHub Copilot
3. Alerts were not tested due to apiKey license restriction
4. To set up code and check functionality you may use VSCode with following code (create field mcp.json inside .vscode directory)
   
    ```json
    //.vscode/mcp.json
    {
        "servers": {
            "simple-mcp-server": {
                "type": "stdio",
                "command": "dotnet",
                "args": [
                    "run",
                    "--project",
                    "${workspaceFolder}/src/Weather.McpServer/Weather.McpServer.csproj",
                    "--configuration",
                    "Debug"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
                },
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/artifacts/bin/Weather.McpServer/debug",
            }
        }
    }
    ```
5. Project is divided in 3 logical parts: 
   1. WeatherMcpServer - the MCP server itself
   2. Core - abstractions
   3. WeatherAPI - WeatherAPI calls
6. Logs/Errors are managed by Serilog (I save them to file)
7. Central Package Management is set 

8. What needs to be done:
   1. Add testing project to test WeatherAPI (some xUnit or vUnit)
   2. It would be nice if we use DevProxy for testing project to Mock weather API responses
9. In addition to STDOUT server it's possible to add http endposints and integrate everything into .NET Aspire, which will make code to be ready for production set up and open door for simple telemetry usage and setting.
10. MCP servers are truly exciting thing to work with. Thank you!

## Example calls

1. Write to Copliot
   ```
   #simple-mcp-server get weather in London at the moment
    ```
2. Copliot answers
    ```
    The current weather in London is few clouds with a temperature of 26.55Â°C. Data was retrieved at 13:21:29 UTC.
    ```
